A tiny command‑line utility that scans LiL Ren’Py script files, finds spaced hexadecimal blobs (e.g. "48 65 6c 6c 6f"), translates them to readable text (adding a space after each character), and rewrites the file in‑place with the translated string.

# Usage
python replace_hex.py <path-to-renpy-game-directory>
